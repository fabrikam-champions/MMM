The Microservices Messaging Model (MMM) is a suite of tools and APIs that simplifies the process of understanding communication patterns within a microservices architecture. It achieves this by automatically extracting the message flows between microservices directly from the codebase.

Key Outputs
The MMM generates two key outputs that provide a clear view of how microservices interact:

Communication Model Diagrams: These visual representations depict the interactions between involved microservices. Each diagram focuses on a single microservice, highlighting the messages it produces and consumes in its interactions with other services.
Message Details Wiki Pages: These comprehensive wiki pages provide in-depth information about the messages produced and consumed by each microservice. This includes details like message name, content structure, and any relevant usage info.
Benefits
By automatically generating these outputs, the MMM offers several advantages:

Improved Visibility: It builds a clear understanding of message flows within the microservices architecture, making it easier to identify potential bottlenecks or integration issues.
Simplified Communication: The communication model diagrams provide a shared language for developers working on different microservices, facilitating collaboration and reducing misunderstandings.
Reduced Documentation Overhead: The automated generation of message details wiki pages minimizes the manual effort required to document message specifications.
Overall, the MMM acts as a valuable tool for promoting effective communication and streamlining development efforts within a microservices ecosystem.

Supported Frameworks:
Currently, MMM supports three approaches for detecting messages within .NET microservices:

Using DotNetCore.CAP library (https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNetCore.CAP )
Using MMM.Attributes package for annotation (https://www.nuget.org/packages/MMM.Attributes )
